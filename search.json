    "section": "",
    "text": "The biggest change in the last decade is the number of threes NBA teams are taking. Before, 3-pointers were not the way NBA teams won games, but now, if you want to win, teams look to outscore your opponent by 3.\nEven though it has been proven that you can win an NBA championship by relying on hitting 3s, there are NBA fans who hate this style of play and believe the NBA is unwatchable.\nNBA analysts believe Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors are to blame for this 3-point revolution. They were the first NBA team to win an NBA championship in 2015 by being a 3-point-heavy team. In addition, their star backcourt duo was given the nickname the Splash Brothers because of how good they were at hitting shots from 3.\nYet, I believe there is another player and team that changed the NBA.\nThat is James Harden and the Houston Rockets, The Golden State Warriors’ main competitor from 2015 to 2019.\nYou probably think I am crazy. There is no way the Houston Rockets shot as many or even more threes than the Golden State Warriors, but trust me, you will be surprised.\nHere is a facet wrap comparing the number of 3-point attempts by the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets from 2014 to 2019.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlogs &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Warriors_Rockets_3_Attempts.csv\")\nlogsGOLHOU &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Warriors_Rockets_3_Attempts.csv\")\nleagueaverage &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Average_3_per_season_Real.csv\")\nlogs24 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/NBA_2023_2024_STATS.csv\")\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(\n    data = logs,\n    aes(x = Year, y = `3P Attempts`, group = Team)\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = logs,\n    aes(x = Year, y = `3P Attempts`),\n    size = 2  \n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(20, 50)) +  \n  facet_wrap(~Team, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 4) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"The NBA media lied to you\",\n    subtitle = \"James Harden and the Rockets transformed the NBA's 3-point game\",\n    y = \"3 Point Attempts\", x = \"Year\",\n    caption = \"By: Daniel Mahoney | Source: nba.com\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),  \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),  \n    axis.text = element_text(size = 9),  \n    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),  \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  \n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray\", size = 0.2)  \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers even surprised me because when the Warriors won their first NBA championship in 2015, the narrative was this Golden State team was going to ruin the NBA, and no one was taking threes like them.\nHowever, in 2015, the Houston Rockets were first in 3-point attempts with 32.7 3s per game, while the Warriors shot 27 3s per game.\nBased on how people talk, you would think the Golden State Warriors were the first NBA team in history to take 40 3s per game, but the Houston Rockets were first to do so in 2017 as they attempted 40.3 shots from long distance.\nFrom 2014 to 2019, the Warriors never shot over 40 3s per game. The Houston Rockets attempted 40 3s per game in three straight seasons.\nThe only time the Golden State Warriors shot more 3s than the Houston Rockets during the James Harden era was in 2016. This season, the Warriors won 73 games but lost in the NBA finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nIn 2016, the Warriors shot 31.6 3s per game, and the Rockets shot 30.9 3s per game. This shows that in the one year, the Warriors shot more 3s than the Rockets, there was still no difference.\nJust looking at this facet wrap gives you a good idea that the Rockets were more of a 3-point-heavy team than the Warriors, but there is more.\nHere is a line chart showing the amount of 3s the Warriors and Rockets took and comparing it to the league average for that season.\n\n\nCode\nGOL &lt;- logsGOLHOU |&gt; filter(Team == \"Golden State\")\nHOU &lt;- logsGOLHOU |&gt; filter(Team == \"Houston\")\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(\n    data = GOL, \n    aes(x = Year, y = `3P Attempts`, color = \"Golden State\"),  \n  ) + \n  geom_line(\n    data = HOU, \n    aes(x = Year, y = `3P Attempts`, color = \"Houston\"),  \n  ) + \n  geom_line(\n    data = leagueaverage, \n    aes(x = Year, y = `3P Attempts`, color = \"League Average\"),  \n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = GOL, \n    aes(x = Year, y = `3P Attempts`, color = \"Golden State\"),  \n    size = 2, \n    shape = 16\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = HOU, \n    aes(x = Year, y = `3P Attempts`, color = \"Houston\"),  \n    size = 2, \n    shape = 16\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = leagueaverage, \n    aes(x = Year, y = `3P Attempts`, color = \"League Average\"),  \n    size = 2, \n    shape = 16\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Golden State\" = \"blue\", \"Houston\" = \"red\", \"League Average\" = \"black\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(20, 50)) +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Three Point Attempts\", x = \"Year\",\n    title = \"No one took threes like the Houston Rockets\",\n    subtitle = \"The NBA followed in the footsteps of the Houston Rockets\",\n    caption = \"Source: basketball reference | By Daniel Mahoney\",  \n    color = \"Label\"  \n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 2017, y = 40.7, label = \"40.3\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,  \n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 2018, y = 42.7, label = \"42.3\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,  \n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 2019, y = 45.8, label = \"45.4\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,  \n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 2014, y = 20.9, label = \"21.5\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,  \n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 2015, y = 22, label = \"22.4\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,  \n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 2016, y = 23.7, label = \"24.1\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,  \n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 2017, y = 26.6, label = \"27\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,  \n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n   geom_text(\n    aes(x = 2018, y = 28.6, label = \"29\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,  \n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 2019, y = 31.5, label = \"32\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,  \n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),  \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),  \n    axis.text = element_text(size = 9),  \n    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),  \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  \n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray\", size = 0.2)  \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI created this line chart to show that the Rockets were always way above the league average when it came to 3-point attempts.\nThe other reason is I wanted to highlight that the NBA had its biggest jump in 3-point attempts when the Houston Rockets were attempting 40 3s per game.\nIn 2017, the average amount of 3s attempted in the NBA was 27, but in 2019, that number increased to 32 3s per game, and the Houston Rockets took 45.3, which is insane.\nThe question you are probably asking is why did the Houston Rockets take so many 3s?\nIn 2017, the Houston Rockets hired Mike D’Antoni. D’Antoni is known for building an identity on offense based on the players he has. He was the head coach of the seven seconds or less Phoenix Suns.\nMike D’Antoni realized the Rockets most efficient offense would be running through James Harden. That is why James Harden became one of the most ball-dominant players in the NBA, and the Rockets filled their rosters with guys who would stand at the 3-point line and be ready to shoot when James Harden passed them the ball.\nThis style of play of one player dominating the ball and taking so many 3-pointers was criticized, but it led to success.\nAs the Houston Rockets were a top 2 offense in the NBA for three straight seasons, combine this with the Rockets trading for Chris Paul in the summer of 2017, and they became the second scariest team in the NBA.\nWith Mike as the Rockets head coach, Houston went to the Conference Finals in 2018 but lost to the Warriors in seven games. James Harden won the Regular Season MVP in 2018, and in 2019, Harden had one of the most historic scoring seasons in NBA history. He averaged 36.1 points per game.\nThe NBA saw this success and thought this was the best chance of winning. Which is the ultimate compliment to James Harden. He was so good that the rest of the NBA had to adjust to his play style.\nI am not mad at the Houston Rockets because they realized that with the players they had and with James Harden being one of the best NBA players in the league. This style of play would be their best chance of winning a championship.\nThe question I have. Does 3-point shooting lead to wins in the NBA?\nThis bubble chart, with the dot size scaled by the number of wins, shows that the best NBA teams have their own identity that helps them win basketball games.\n\n\nCode\nGoodTeams &lt;- logs24 |&gt;  \n  filter(Wins &gt; 49)\nBoston &lt;- GoodTeams |&gt;  \n  filter(Wins &gt; 62)\nDenver &lt;- GoodTeams |&gt;  \n  filter(Team == \"Denver Nuggets\")\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = logs24,\n    aes(\n      x = `3P Attempts`, \n      y = `3P Percentage`, \n      size = Wins\n    ),\n    alpha = 0.6  \n  ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data = GoodTeams, \n    aes(\n      x = `3P Attempts`, \n      y = `3P Percentage`, \n      size = Wins\n    ),\n    alpha = 0.6,  \n    color = \"blue\"\n  ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data = Boston, \n    aes(\n      x = `3P Attempts`, \n      y = `3P Percentage`, \n      size = Wins\n    ),\n    alpha = 0.6,  \n    color = \"green\"\n  ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data = Denver, \n    aes(\n      x = `3P Attempts`, \n      y = `3P Percentage`, \n      size = Wins\n    ),\n    alpha = 0.6,  \n    color = \"#FFCC00\"\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = GoodTeams,  \n    aes(\n      x = `3P Attempts`, \n      y = `3P Percentage`, \n      label = Team\n    ),\n    box.padding = 0.5,\n    point.padding = 0.5,\n    max.overlaps = 10\n  ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(\n    breaks = c(45, 50, 55, 60),\n    labels = c(\"45\", \"50\", \"55\", \"60\"),\n    range = c(2, 6)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Three Point Attempts\",\n    y = \"Three Point Percentage\",\n    title = \"While NBA teams are taking more 3s\",\n    subtitle = \"The most successful NBA teams have an identity shaped by their players\",\n    caption = \"Source: nba.com | By Daniel Mahoney\",\n    size = \"Wins\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 42.3, y = 38.3, label = \"NBA\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,\n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 42.3, y = 38.1, label = \"Champs\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,\n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n   geom_text(\n    aes(x = 40.7, y = 38.1, label = \"Most 3s\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,\n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 31.5, y = 36.95, label = \"Fewest 3s\"),\n    color = \"black\",\n    size = 4,\n    vjust = -1,\n    hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  guides(size = guide_legend(title = \"Wins\", override.aes = list(color = \"#333333\"))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),  \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),  \n    axis.text = element_text(size = 9),  \n    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),  \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  \n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray\", size = 0.2)  \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you will realize that the NBA champions, Boston Celtics, won 64 games last year and shot 42.5 3s per game.\nThis may frustrate you. However, what I am going to tell you is that taking 3s gives the Celtics the best chance of winning games.\nEveryone in that starting lineup can shoot 3s. Boston was second in the league in 3-point percentage, shooting 38.8% from 3. This shows that Boston is good at hitting 3-pointers and playing the analytical game works in the Celtic’s favor.\nHowever, taking 3s does not work for everyone. Look at the Denver Nuggets, who took the least amount of 3s in the NBA. They won 57 games in the regular season last year.\nThat is because Denver runs their offense through the three-time MVP. Nikola Jokic who is not reliant on hitting threes.\nJokic relies on his incredible post-up game and passing to get him and his teammates easy shots in the paint. Even though the Nuggets did not take 3s, they were sixth in paint points, scoring 52.8 points in the paint. This is a different style of play than the Boston Celtics.\nThe point is even though the NBA has become reliant on hitting shots from deep, the best NBA teams have their own identity based on the talent on their roster.\nYou can not copy and do what the best does because you can not outplay the best at their own game.\nThe most successful NBA teams have their own identity. For example, the Houston Rockets in 2018 and 2019, led by prime James Harden, the one who really changed the NBA."

This was higher than the Memphis Grizzlies and the Dallas Mavericks, two teams that ultimately made the playoffs.\nIn the last ten years, teams in the West that have been among the Top 8 in net rating in the conference have made the Western Conference playoffs 88.8% of the time.\nThe Suns’ success was driven by their elite offense, ranking in the Top 10 in several offensive categories.\nThey averaged 105.2 points per game, placing 7th in the NBA, and recorded an offensive rating of 108.2, which ranked 8th in the league. Offensive rating measures a team’s efficiency, showing how many points they score per 100 possessions.\n\n\nCode\nPoints &lt;- logs14 |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    `Points Per Game` = mean(PTS),         \n    `Offensive Rating` = mean(OFFRTG),     \n  )  \nPointsSuns &lt;- logs14 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Phoenix Suns\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    `Points Per Game` = mean(PTS),         \n    `Offensive Rating` = mean(OFFRTG),     \n  )  \nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = Points, aes(x = `Points Per Game`, y = `Offensive Rating`), color=\"#768188\") +\n  geom_point(data = PointsSuns, aes(x = `Points Per Game`, y = `Offensive Rating`), color=\"#FBAF6F\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = PointsSuns, \n    aes(x = `Points Per Game`, y = `Offensive Rating`, label = Team),\n    hjust = 0.5,   \n    vjust = 0.5  \n  ) + \n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 104.4, y = 111.5, label = \"Good Scoring, Strong Rating\"), \n    color = \"#333333\", face = \"bold\", \n    hjust = 0.5, \n    vjust = 0.5   \n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 97, y = 100, label = \"Bad Scoring, Weak Rating\"), \n    color = \"#333333\", face = \"bold\",\n    hjust = 0.5,  \n    vjust = 0.5  \n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 97, y = 111.5, label = \"Bad Scoring, Strong Rating\"), \n    color = \"#333333\", face = \"bold\",\n    hjust = 0.5,  \n    vjust = 0.5   \n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 104.4, y = 100, label = \"Good Scoring, Weak Rating\"), \n    color = \"#333333\", face = \"bold\",\n    hjust = 0.5,  \n    vjust = 0.5   \n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Points Per Game\",\n    y = \"Offensive Rating\", \n    title = \"The Suns were dominate offensively\",\n    subtitle = \" Phoenix ranked Top 10 in both points per game and offensive rating\",\n    caption = \"Source: nba.com | By Daniel Mahoney\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"#5D1F8E\", size = 16, face = 'bold'),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#F4D3EC\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#5D1F8E\", size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 101, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 105.7, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 101, y = 105.7, label = \"League Average\", color = \"black\", size = 4, fontface = \"bold\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Arizona-based team was also highly efficient in its shooting, ranking 8th in both field goal and three-point percentage.

Meanwhile, the Atlanta Hawks finished with 38 wins but still made the NBA Playoffs as the 8th seed.\nWhat is interesting is that the Suns finished with the same number of wins as the Raptors.

The losses to the Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies proved to cost them. On April 12th, Phoenix fell to the Mavericks 101-98, followed by a 97-91 loss to the Grizzlies just two days later.\nThose two teams were competing with the Suns for playoff positioning, and if Phoenix had won both games, we would have seen this Suns team in the 2014 NBA playoffs."
