    "section": "",
    "text": "The biggest change in the last decade is the amount of threes NBA teams are taking. Before, 3-pointers were not the way NBA teams won games, but now if you want to win most teams look to outscore their opponent from 3.\nEven though it has been proven that you can win an NBA championship by being reliant on hitting 3s. There are NBA fans that hate this style of play and believe the NBA is unwatchable.\nNBA analysts believe Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors are to blame for this 3-point revolution. As they were the first NBA team to win an NBA championship in 2015 by being a 3-point heavy team. To add on to that their star back court duo were given the nickname the “Splash Brothers” because of how good they were at hitting shots from 3.\nYet, I believe there is another player and team that changed the NBA.\nThat is James Harden and the Houston Rockets, the Golden State Warriors biggest competitor during the years 2015-2019.\nYou probably think I am crazy, you probably think there is no way the Houston Rockets shot as many or even more threes than the Golden State Warriors, but trust me you will be surprised.\nHere is a facet wrap comparing the number of 3-pointers attempted by both the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets from 2014 to 2019.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlogs &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Warriors_Rockets_3_Attempts.csv\")\nlogsGOLHOU &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Warriors_Rockets_3_Attempts.csv\")\nleagueaverage &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Average_3_per_season_Real.csv\")\nlogs24 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/NBA_2023_2024_STATS.csv\")\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(\n    data = logs,\n    aes(x = Year, y = `3P Attempts`, group = Team)\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = logs,\n    aes(x = Year, y = `3P Attempts`),\n    size = 2  \n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(20, 50)) +  \n  facet_wrap(~Team, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 4) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"The Houston Rockets reshaped the NBA with the 3-Point Revolution\",\n    subtitle = \"James Harden and the Rockets transformed the NBA's 3-point game\",\n    y = \"3 Point Attempts\", x = \"Year\",\n    caption = \"By: Daniel Mahoney | Source: nba.com\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),  \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),  \n    axis.text = element_text(size = 9),  \n    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),  \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  \n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray\", size = 0.2)  \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nGOL &lt;- logsGOLHOU |&gt;

    "text": "The 2013-2014 NBA season was filled with unforgettable storylines: LeBron James played his final season with the Miami Heat, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Heat to win their fifth NBA Championship in a Finals rematch.\nHowever, people need to remember how competitive the Western Conference was during this dynamic NBA season. Eight teams won 49 games or more, and the 9th seed won 48 games but missed the playoffs.\nThat team was the Phoenix Suns. In a shocking turnaround, the Suns went from a sad 25 wins in 2013 to an impressive 48 wins in 2014, surpassing expectations.\nThis team should have made the 2014 playoffs.\nThe numbers tell the story!\nLet’s start with net rating, a stat in the NBA that calculates point differential across 100 possessions.

Would they be able to stand out?\nThis bubble chart, with the dot size scaled by the number of wins, shows that the Suns would have been exceptional in the East, especially compared to the teams that made the Eastern Conference playoffs (the teams that are labeled).\n\n\nCode\nEastNet &lt;- logs14 |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"East\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    `Offensive Rating` = mean(OFFRTG),\n    `Defensive Rating` = mean(DEFRTG),\n    Wins = sum(W)\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(Team, Wins, `Offensive Rating`, `Defensive Rating`) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Wins))  \nEastNetPlayoffs &lt;- logs14 %&gt;%\n  filter(Conference == \"East\") %&gt;%\n  filter(W &gt; 37) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Team) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    `Offensive Rating` = mean(OFFRTG, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `Defensive Rating` = mean(DEFRTG, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Wins = sum(W, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(Team, Wins, `Offensive Rating`, `Defensive Rating`) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Wins))\n Phoenix &lt;- logs14 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Phoenix Suns\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    `Offensive Rating` = mean(OFFRTG),\n    `Defensive Rating` = mean(DEFRTG),\n    Wins = sum(W)\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(Team, Wins, `Offensive Rating`, `Defensive Rating`) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Wins))\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = Phoenix, aes(x = `Offensive Rating`, y = `Defensive Rating`, size = Wins), alpha = .75, color = \"#E55B00\") +\n  geom_point(data = EastNet, aes(x = `Offensive Rating`, y = `Defensive Rating`, size = Wins), alpha = .75, color = \"#999999\") +\n  geom_point(data = EastNetPlayoffs, aes(x = `Offensive Rating`, y = `Defensive Rating`, size = Wins), alpha = .6, color = \"#D85A5A\") +\n  geom_text(data = Phoenix, aes(x = `Offensive Rating`, y = `Defensive Rating`, label = Team), hjust = 0.5, vjust = -1, size = 3) +\n  geom_text(data = EastNetPlayoffs, aes(x = `Offensive Rating`, y = `Defensive Rating`, label = Team), hjust = 0.5, vjust = -1.5, size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 108, y = 110, label = \"Better Offensive Teams\", color = \"#333333\", size = 3) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 108, y = 101.7, label = \"Balanced Teams\", color = \"#333333\", size = 3) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 101, y = 110, label = \"Struggling Teams\", color = \"#333333\", size = 3) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 101, y = 101.7, label = \"Better Defensive Teams\", color = \"#333333\", size = 3) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 104.1, y = 105.2, label = \"The Average\", color = \"black\", size = 4, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 108, y = 107.2, label = \"Both Teams Won 48 Games\", color = \"#333333\", size = 3.3, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_encircle(data=Phoenix, aes(x=`Offensive Rating`-0.2, y=`Defensive Rating`), s_shape=.01, expand=.0000000003, colour=\"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Offensive Rating (Higher is Better)\",\n    y = \"Defensive Rating (Lower is Better)\",\n    title = \"Phoenix would have dominated the East\",  \n    subtitle = \"With 48 wins, the Suns would have been tied for the 3rd seed in the weaker conference\",  \n    caption = \"Source: nba.com | By Daniel Mahoney\",  \n    size = \"Wins\"  \n  ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(\n    breaks = c(30, 36, 42, 48),\n    labels = c(\"30\", \"36\", \"42\", \"48\"),\n    range = c(2, 6)\n  ) +\n  guides(size = guide_legend(title = \"Wins\", override.aes = list(color = \"#333333\"))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(color = \"#5D1F8E\", size = 16, face = 'bold'),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#F4D3EC\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#5D1F8E\", size = 11),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 104.1, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 105.6, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly one team in the East had a better offensive rating than the Phoenix Suns, the Miami Heat, who had the star trio of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh.\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that the third-seeded Toronto Raptors finished with the same number of wins as the Suns. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Hawks finished with 38 wins but still made the NBA Playoffs as the 8th seed.\nWhat is interesting is that the Suns finished with the same number of wins as the Raptors. Even though the Suns played 52 games against the West and 30 games against the East, the team from Canada played 52 games against the East and 30 games against the West.\nImagine if Phoenix was in the East, and 52 of their opponents were against teams in the East. They would have easily surpassed 48 wins.\nHowever, the Phoenix Suns did enough to make the playoffs in the West. There were stretches during the season when they were in the playoff picture.\n\n\nCode\nteam_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"#A9A9A9\",  # San Antonio\n  \"#87CEEB\", # Oklahoma City\n  \"#C8102E\", # Los Angeles\n  \"#000000\", # Houston\n   \"#D2691E\", # Portland\n  \"#FFC72C\", # Golden State\n  \"#E56020\",  # Phoenix\n  \"#00538C\", # Dallas\n  \"#00285E\"  # Memphis\n)\nteam_color_map &lt;- setNames(team_colors, unique(rankingsnba$Team))\nggplot(data = rankingsnba, aes(x = Date, y = Rank, color = Team, group = Team)) +\n  geom_bump(size = 1) +  \n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = team_color_map) +  \n  scale_y_reverse(breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Phoenix playoff hopes vanished during the final week\", \n    subtitle = \"The Suns held the 7th seed until the final week of the regular season, falling to 9th\",\n    caption = \"Source: basketballreference.com | By Daniel Mahoney\",\n    x = \"Date\", \n    y = \"Playoff Seed\", \n    color = \"Team\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    title = element_text(color = \"#5D1F8E\", size = 15, face = 'bold'),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#F4D3EC\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#5D1F8E\", size = 11),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Suns picked the worst possible time to slump, losing three of their final four games. The losses to the Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies proved to cost them. On April 12th, Phoenix fell to the Mavericks 101-98, followed by a 97-91 loss to the Grizzlies just two days later.\nThose two teams were competing with the Suns for playoff positioning, and if Phoenix had won both games, we would have seen this Suns team in the 2014 NBA playoffs."
