    "text": "The 2013-2014 NBA season was filled with unforgettable storylines: LeBron James played his final season with the Miami Heat, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Heat to win their fifth NBA Championship in a Finals rematch.\nHowever, people need to remember how competitive the Western Conference was during this dynamic NBA season. Eight teams won 49 games or more, and the 9th seed won 48 games but missed the playoffs.\nThat team was the Phoenix Suns. In a shocking turnaround, the Suns went from a sad 25 wins in 2013 to an impressive 48 wins in 2014, surpassing expectations.\nThis team should have made the 2014 playoffs.\nThe numbers tell the story!\nLet’s start with net rating, a stat in the NBA that calculates point differential across 100 possessions. Good teams have a higher net rating, while bad teams have a lower net rating.\nHere is the net rating of every Western Conference team during the 2013-2014 NBA season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlogs14 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/NBA_2013_2014_STATS.csv\")\nrankingsnba &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Standing_By_Dates_West.csv\")\nWestNet &lt;- logs14 |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"West\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    `Net Rating` = mean(NETRTG),\n    Wins = sum(W),  \n    Losses = sum(L)      \n  ) |&gt;\n  select(Team, Wins, Losses, `Net Rating`) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Wins)) \nWestNet |&gt; \n ungroup() |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"According to net rating, Phoenix was a top 8 team in the West\",\n    subtitle = \"The Suns posted a better net rating than both the 7th seed and 8th seed in the West\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Daniel Mahoney  |  **Source:** nba.com: Teams Advanced | Stats | NBA.com\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#00538C\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\" )\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Dallas Mavericks\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#00285E\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Memphis Grizzlies\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#E56020\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Phoenix Suns\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Net Rating`),\n      rows = `Net Rating` &gt; 0\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\ntab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Net Rating`),\n      rows = `Net Rating` &lt; 0\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to net rating, Phoenix was a top 8 team in the West\n\n\nThe Suns posted a better net rating than both the 7th seed and 8th seed in the West\n\n\nTeam\nWins\nLosses\nNet Rating\n\n\n\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n62\n20\n8.1\n\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n59\n23\n6.4\n\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n57\n25\n7.3\n\n\nHouston Rockets\n54\n28\n4.6\n\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n54\n28\n4.2\n\n\nGolden State Warriors\n51\n31\n4.9\n\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n50\n32\n1.7\n\n\nDallas Mavericks\n49\n33\n2.3\n\n\nPhoenix Suns\n48\n34\n2.6\n\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n40\n42\n2.6\n\n\nDenver Nuggets\n36\n46\n-2.2\n\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n34\n48\n-3.0\n\n\nSacramento Kings\n28\n54\n-2.7\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n27\n55\n-6.0\n\n\nUtah Jazz\n25\n57\n-7.6\n\n\n\nBy: Daniel Mahoney | Source: nba.com: Teams Advanced | Stats | NBA.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix finished with the seventh-best net rating in the Western Conference in 2014, posting a rating of 2.6. This was higher than the Memphis Grizzlies and the Dallas Mavericks, two teams that ultimately made the playoffs.\nThe Suns’ success was driven by their elite offense, ranking in the Top 10 in several offensive categories.\nThey averaged 105.2 points per game, placing 7th in the NBA, and recorded an offensive rating of 108.2, which ranked 8th in the league. Offensive rating measures a team’s efficiency, showing how many points they score per 100 possessions.\n\n\nCode\nPoints &lt;- logs14 |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    `Points Per Game` = mean(PTS),         \n    `Offensive Rating` = mean(OFFRTG),     \n  )  \nPointsSuns &lt;- logs14 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Phoenix Suns\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    `Points Per Game` = mean(PTS),         \n    `Offensive Rating` = mean(OFFRTG),     \n  )  \nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = Points, aes(x = `Points Per Game`, y = `Offensive Rating`), color=\"#768188\") +\n  geom_point(data = PointsSuns, aes(x = `Points Per Game`, y = `Offensive Rating`), color=\"#FBAF6F\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = PointsSuns, \n    aes(x = `Points Per Game`, y = `Offensive Rating`, label = Team),\n    hjust = 0.5,   \n    vjust = 0.5  \n  ) + \n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 104, y = 111.5, label = \"Good Offensive Rating and Good Scoring\"), \n    color = \"navy\", face = \"bold\", \n    hjust = 0.5, \n    vjust = 0.5   \n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 96, y = 100, label = \"Bad Offensive Rating and Bad Scoring\"), \n    color = \"navy\", face = \"bold\",\n    hjust = 0.5,  \n    vjust = 0.5  \n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 96, y = 111.5, label = \"Good Offensive Rating and Bad Scoring\"), \n    color = \"navy\", face = \"bold\",\n    hjust = 0.5,  \n    vjust = 0.5   \n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 104, y = 100, label = \"Bad Offensive Rating and Good Scoring\"), \n    color = \"navy\", face = \"bold\",\n    hjust = 0.5,  \n    vjust = 0.5   \n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Points Per Game\",\n    y = \"Offensive Rating\", \n    title = \"The Suns were dominate offensively\",\n    subtitle = \" Phoenix ranked Top 10 in both points per game and offensive rating\",\n    caption = \"Source: nba.com | By Daniel Mahoney\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"#5D1F8E\", size = 16, face = 'bold'),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#EEC9E5\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#5D1F8E\", size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 101, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 105.7, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 101, y = 105.7, label = \"League Average\", color = \"black\", size = 4, fontface = \"bold\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix was also highly efficient in their shooting, ranking 8th in both field goal and three-point percentage.

Meanwhile, the Atlanta Hawks finished with 38 wins but still made the NBA Playoffs as the 8th seed.\nWhat is interesting is that the Suns finished with the same number of wins as the Raptors. Even though the Suns played 52 games against the West and 30 games against the East, the Raptors played 52 games against the East and 30 games against the West because the Raptors are in the East.\nImagine if Phoenix was in the East, and 52 of their opponents were against teams in the East. They would have easily surpassed 48 wins.\nHowever, the Phoenix Suns did enough to make the playoffs in the West.

The losses to the Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies proved to cost them. On April 12th, Phoenix fell to the Mavericks 101-98, followed by a 97-91 loss to the Grizzlies just two days later.\nThose two teams were competing with the Suns for playoff positioning, and if Phoenix had won both games, we would have seen this Suns team in the 2014 playoffs."
